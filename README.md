# Python-Projects
This does not represent a complete collection of my works, nor do I consider it finished in its current state. The contents of this repository are updated regularly and new projects will continuously be added.

As always, any and all criticisms are appreciated. However, many of these programs will be left flawed and inefficient, in an effort to display my growth as a student, and a fledgling programmer.

Any programs I found entertaining but lacking in execution, I will eventually return to and attempt again. These updates will be placed in the same files with the added title of "REMASTERED".
